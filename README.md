An exercise for the new Project with Emil and Jose
## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
The scripts are available in the **package.json** file in the project

- `npm dev` - Runs the app in the development mode on port 5173.
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder

## Libraries

In addition to [react](https://react.dev/) the following libraries are used in the project:

- Routing: [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- Form State Management: Working with forms: [react-hook-form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/)
- Styles: [tailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Most recent activity algorithm

To solve this challenge in the most efficient way I took the approach of *Counting and Tracking*, which is designed for efficient data processing and focuses on reducing the computational complexity.
